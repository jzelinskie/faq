faq is a tool intended to be a more flexible [jq], supporting additional formats.
The additional formats are converted into JSON and processed with [libjq].

Supported formats:
- BSON
- Bencode
- JSON
- Property Lists
- TOML
- XML
- YAML

How do you pronounce faq? The same way you would insult a particularly nasty structured document: "F♥︎♥︎♥︎ You". 

For example usage, read [the examples doc].

## Installation

The `master` branch may be in an *unstable or even broken state* during development.
Please use [releases] instead of the `master` branch in order to get stable binaries.

Behavior such as command-line flags may change causing shell scripts using faq to break after upgrading.
jq programs are stable and should be considered a bug if it does not match jq behavior.

- Statically compiled binaries are available on the [releases] page: just download the binary for your platform, and make it executable.
- A [Homebrew] formula can be installed with `brew install jzelinskie/faq/faq`
- On macOS, you can also install through [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org): `sudo port install faq` ([info](https://ports.macports.org/port/faq/))
- RPMs are available via a [COPR repository]. 
- There's an [AUR PKGBUILD] for Arch Linux that can be installed with your favorite [AUR tooling].

## Development

In order to compile the project, the [latest stable version of Go] and knowledge of a [working Go environment] are required.
A version of [jq] greater than 1.6-rc2 that includes the libjq header files must also be installed on the system.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:jzelinskie/faq.git
cd faq
make all
```

With Docker and [buildx bake](https://github.com/docker/buildx/blob/master/docs/reference/buildx_bake.md#description):

```shell
# build docker image and output to docker with faq:local tag (default)
docker buildx bake image-local

# create builder for multi-arch build (see below)
docker buildx create --name faq-builder

# build multi-platform image
docker buildx bake image-all

# create the artifact matching your current platform in ./dist
docker buildx bake artifact

# create artifacts for many platforms in ./dist
docker buildx bake artifact-all

# run tests
docker buildx bake test

# lint
docker buildx bake lint
```
